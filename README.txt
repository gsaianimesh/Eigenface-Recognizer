Hello! This is an Eigenfaces Face Recognition project.
To run it, you will need to follow these steps.

==================================================
STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON

If you don't have Python 3, please install it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

==================================================
STEP 2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (LIBRARIES)

Open your computer's terminal or command prompt (CMD).

Navigate to this project folder (the one containing this README file).

Type the following command and press Enter:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, and other needed libraries.

==================================================
STEP 3: RUN THE BACKEND SERVER

In the same terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

python app.py

You will see text in the terminal, ending with "Backend server is running!".

LEAVE THIS TERMINAL OPEN. It is the "brain" of the application.

==================================================
STEP 4: RUN THE FRONTEND

Go to the project folder in your file explorer.

Find the file index.html.

Double-click index.html to open it in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

The application should now be fully working! You can upload images to test the recognizer or add new people to the dataset.
